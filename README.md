# Install Instructions

- Please note the install script is still in an alpha state
- Currently the install script only supports the install of Qtile, AwesomeWM, Neofetch and Qutebrowser configs.
- The install script DOES NOT install the actual programs, it only installs my configs hosted in this repo.

1. Clone respository to your computer and make the install script executable:
```
git clone https://github.com/DanCarzano/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
```
2. Launch the install script:
```
./install.sh
```
3. Make sure you go through and backup existing directories. Use the backup section of the install script for this. 

# Qtile

- Workplace Icons on the bar are from the Font Awesome 5 Free pack, without this installed you will only see text instead of the workplace icons
- Compositor in use is Picom. Config is expected to be in .config/qtile/scripts/picom.conf
- Picom fork in use is from https://github.com/jonaburg/picom

# AwesomeWM

- This config is using FreeDesktop and a heavily modified version of the PowerArrow Theme
- I suggest using XFCE as a base to install AwesomeWM, as this config is looking for a number of standard XFCE programs to function correctly
- The compositor in use is Picom, the config for this is expected to be found in .config/picom/picom.conf

# Qutebrowser
